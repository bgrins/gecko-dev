# Gecko on Gonk, the return of the revenge.

This is an experiment to see what it takes to build current Gecko on Gonk (M base).

Currently the setup is:
- modify mozconfig-b2g to point to an android NDK (I used 15c since 17b crashes compiling SpiderMonkey on my machine).
- `export MOZCONFIG=mozconfig-b2g`
- `export GONK_PATH=<path_to_you_gonk_repo>`
- run `./mach build`

The build fails because of mismatches between includes from the NDK and local ones from Gonk, like:
```

```

I tried to setup the build more manually with the toolchain flags as environment variables in the `build-b2g.sh` script. This may be the right path but that doesn't work either yet.

Note that Gecko now builds with clang > 3.8 instead of gcc. It's unclear if it's mandatory for now but it's likely that gcc builds will break sooner or later.
